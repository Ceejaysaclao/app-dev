Conclusion

In conclusion, "Spy Kids" have invested a considerable amount of money and creative energy. That is refreshing since live-action “family fare” usually gets a studio’s table scraps. Rodriguez’s intelligent, thrill-a-minute script is (with rare exceptions) kid-friendly, yet adults should enjoy it too.
